# Universities App
## What you'll build
### App that allows the user to get country universities. Uses a `RecyclerView`, `Retrofit` to display a list of universities from REST API via internet. Each element contains an city and university name.

### Add `EditText` for country and `Button` and `RecyclerView` to the app.
### And when you click the `Button`, it will display all the universities in the country you have entered.

### And you can use this `http://universities.hipolabs.com/search?country=saudi%20arabia` url to get universities.
